# stressful_memory
Tools for physics based machine learning for predictive design of HEAs with optimal fatigue endurance limits.

## Setup instructions
Replace 'your_database_path' in the code with the actual path to your persistent datastore.

Save the code in a file (e.g., app.py), then run the app with the command:

```python app.py```

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8050 to see the Dash app. It will display a table with the data from the DocArray. The table is editable and supports filtering and sorting.
